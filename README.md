# Tail Assignment Problem (TAP) Solution


## Project Overview

The **Tail Assignment Problem (TAP)** involves efficiently assigning aircraft to flights, aiming to minimize operational costs while meeting a set of practical constraints. This problem is a crucial optimization challenge in the airline industry, where the objective is to ensure that the right aircraft is assigned to the right flight, maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs.

This repository contains the solution to the TAP, which includes:

- A **mathematical model** that captures the key constraints and objectives of the problem.
- A **Python implementation** that applies this model to a set of provided test instances, allowing for flexible and scalable fleet assignment solutions.
